# Let's say we want to make a simple virtual pet, a baby dragon.
# Like most babies, it should be able to eat, sleep, and poop,
# which means we will need to be able to feed it, put it to bed,
# and take it on walks.
# Internally, our dragon will need to keep track of if it is hungry, tired, or needs to go,
# but we won't be able to see that when we interact with our dragon,
# just like you can't ask a human baby, "Are you hungry?".
# We'll also add a few other fun ways we can interact with our baby dragon,
# and when he is born we'll give him a name.
# (Whatever you pass into the  new method is passed into the initialize method for you.)
